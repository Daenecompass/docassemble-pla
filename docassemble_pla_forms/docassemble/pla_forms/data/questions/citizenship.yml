    The federal government is the largest funder of Philadelphia Legal
    Assistance (PLA), and the government imposes a number of
    requirements on PLA.  One of these requirements is that PLA obtain
    documentation that all of its clients are either citizens,
    permanent residents, refugees, asylees, or persons in the process
    of becoming permanent residents.  Some exceptions apply.

    If you are a citizen, we need a signed document from you, a
    "Citizenship Attestation," in which you say that you are a
    citizen.  If you are an immigrant, we do not need your signature,
    but we need a copy of your immigration documentation.

    This web site allows you to sign a Citizenship Attestation or
    upload a copy (or a photograph) of your immigration documentation.
    If you are not able to submit the documentation using this web
    site, you can submit it by mail, fax, or in person.  Please
    contact ${ advocate } at PLA to make arrangements to provide the
    documentation by one of these methods.  You can reach ${ advocate
    } at ${ advocate.email } or ${ advocate.workphone }.

question: Documentation of immigration status is needed
subquestion: |
  Funding for free legal assistance is only available to citizens and to persons with certain immigration statuses.  The federal government requires us to obtain documentation of citizenship status or immigration status from the people we assist.

  Since you are not a citizen, we need a copy of your immigration documentation for our records.  If you are a lawful permanent resident, we need a copy of your permanent resident card (green card).  If you are an asylee, we need a copy of the court order granting asylum.  Other immigration statuses have different types of documentation.
