  heading: What is the purpose of this survey?
  content: |
    Every five years, [Philadelphia Legal
    Assistance](http://philalegal.org) conducts a “needs assessment.”
    We survey applicants, clients, staff, members of our board, and
    community organizations.  We ask them: what are the most
    significant civil (non-criminal) legal needs in Philadelphia’s
    neighborhoods?  What are the most significant problems affecting
    our client community?  We will use the information we gather to
    make decisions about how to use our limited resources.

    We would appreciate it very much if you could fill out this short
    survey in order to help us with our 2015 needs assessment.
    
    % if user_type == 'client':
    This survey is anonymous and it will not affect the services you

question: |
  Philadelphia Legal Assistance Needs Assessment Survey of 2015
decoration: pla_logo
subquestion: |
  Thank you for taking our needs assessment survey!

  % if user_type not in ['board', 'staff']:
  As you may know, [Philadelphia Legal Assistance] is a non-profit
  legal services organization that, along with our sister
  organization, [CLS], provides legal advice and representation in
  civil legal matters to low-income residents of Philadelphia.
  % endif
  
  We are conducting this survey because we want to know what *you*
  think about the kinds of cases [PLA] should take and what kinds of
  broad-based advocacy efforts we should pursue.  Since we have
  limited resources, we cannot do everything; we have to set
  priorities, and we want to set priorities with *your* input.

  We are surveying applicants, clients, staff, members of our
  [board](http://philalegal.org/board), and community organizations.
  We are asking:

  * What are our clients' most significant [civil] (non-criminal)
  legal needs?

  * What are the most significant problems affecting the communities
  where our clients live?

  We will use the information we gather to make decisions about how to
  use our limited resources.

  This survey is completely anonymous; we will not know who provided
  what answers.

  Press **Continue** to get started.

  We are asking this question because every advocate at [Philadelphia
  Legal Assistance] spends some part of his or her time engaged in
  activities that do not involve representing low-income clients.  Our
  advocates serve on city-wide task forces to address particular
  issues, such as housing security, economic development, hoarding,
  and other issues.  We also represent non-profit groups such as the
  [Philadelphia Unemployment Project], whose membership primarily consists
  of low-income people.

  We do these activities because the mission of legal services is not
  only to provide legal services to low-income individuals, but to use
  the power of lawyers and the law to most effectively advance the
  interests of low-income people as a whole.

  Because of restrictions on our funding, [PLA] cannot lobby City
  Council, the state or federal legislatures, or government agencies.
  Nevertheless, we are able to, and do, engage in many types of
  activities that have a systemic impact.

  Given that there are so many things that our advocates could do with
  do with their limited time, what types of issues should we
  prioritize?

  Our [Board of Directors] sets priorities for [PLA] in the use of our
  resources, and reconsiders these priorities on an annual basis.  The
  board would like your input on what those priorities should be.
