  heading: What is the purpose of this survey?
  content: |
    Every five years, Philadelphia Legal Assistance conducts a “needs
    assessment.”  We survey applicants, clients, members of our board,
    and community organizations.  We ask them: what are the most
    significant civil (non-criminal) legal needs in Philadelphia’s
    neighborhoods?  What are the most significant problems affecting
    our client community?  We will use the information we gather to
    make decisions about how to use our limited resources.

    We would appreciate it very much if you could fill out this short
    survey in order to help us with our 2015 needs assessment.

    This survey is anonymous and it will not affect the services you
    receive.
