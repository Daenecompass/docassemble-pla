question: Documentation of immigration status is needed
subquestion: |
  Funding for free legal assistance is only available to citizens and to persons with certain immigration statuses.  Our funder requires us to obtain documentation of citizenship status or immigration status from the people we assist.

  Since you are not a citizen, we need a copy of your immigration documentation for our records.  If you are a lawful permanent resident, we need a copy of your permanent resident card (green card).  If you are an asylee, we need a copy of the court order granting asylum.  Other immigration statuses have different types of documentation.
